# Pen Spring Diffraction
This is a Jupyter Notebook that illustrates the following concepts based on an experiment:

1. Single slit diffraction
2. Diffraction by a pen spring (or any regular helix)

The apparatus for the experiment is extremely simple:

* 3D-printed holder for a generic Chinese laser pointer
* typical pen spring
* a surface to shine your pattern on!

The variables are easily changable in the notebook itself, so don't fret!

This experiment is significant because it is through studying the diffraction pattern of DNA (which heavily resembles what we see from the pen spring) that we conclude DNA has the shape of a regular helix.
