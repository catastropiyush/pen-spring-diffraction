# Pen Spring Diffraction
This is a Jupyter Notebook that illustrates the following concepts based on an experiment:

1. Single slit diffraction
2. Diffraction by a pen spring (or any regular helix)

If you have no idea how to go about doing the above, try https://notebooks.azure.com/

1. Go to: https://notebooks.azure.com/tlkh-sutd/libraries/pen-spring-diffraction
2. Log in using your Microsoft account (Office 365 enterprise login also works)
3. Click `Clone` to duplicate the note into your own library
4. Click on `diffraction.ipynb` and press `Run`

The apparatus for the experiment is extremely simple:

* 3D-printed holder for a generic Chinese laser pointer
* typical pen spring
* a surface to shine your pattern on!

This experiment is significant because it is through studying the diffraction pattern of DNA (which heavily resembles what we see from the pen spring) that we conclude DNA has the shape of a regular helix.
